# Artificial Intelligence for Big Data
This is the code repository for [Artificial Intelligence for Big Data](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-big-data?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788472173), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
In this age of big data, companies have larger amount of consumer data than ever before, far more than what the current technologies can ever hope to keep up with. However, Artificial Intelligence closes the gap by moving past human limitations in order to analyze data.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
StopWordsRemover remover = new StopWordsRemover()
  .setInputCol("raw")
  .setOutputCol("filtered");

```

The chapters in this book are sequenced in such a way that the reader can progressively learn about Artificial Intelligence for Big Data starting from the fundamentals and eventually move towards cognitive intelligence. Chapter 1, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Systems, to Chapter 5, Deep Big Data Analytics, cover the basic theory of machine learning and establish the foundation for practical approaches to AI. Starting from Chapter 6, Natural Language Processing, we conceptualize theory into practical implementations and possible use cases. To get the most out of this book, it is recommended that the first five chapters are read in order. From Chapter 6, Natural Language Processing, onward, the reader can choose any topic of interest and read in whatever sequence they prefer.
